# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Discovery Playbooks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create playbooks for discovering business signals from open-web sources.
# Details:
Implement Playbook 1 for hiring signals by scanning career pages and job boards. Implement Playbook 2 for business profile matching using public pages and directories. Ensure that all playbooks respect robots.txt and store provenance of data. Use Playwright for web crawling and ensure polite rate limiting.

Completed (heuristic/offline mode):
- Hiring Signals Playbook implemented at `backend/src/playbooks/hiring.ts`
- Business Profile Playbook implemented at `backend/src/playbooks/businessProfile.ts`
- Shared playbook types in `backend/src/playbooks/types.ts`
- Orchestrated via `/api/discovery` Fastify routes (`backend/src/routes/discovery.ts`), registered in `backend/src/index.ts`

Notes:
- Current implementation uses deterministic heuristics (no live crawling) due to restricted network. Structure is ready to replace with Playwright-based crawlers with robots.txt respect and rate limiting.

# Test Strategy:
Run playbooks on test URLs to verify that correct signals are captured. Check that provenance is stored and that robots.txt is respected. Validate data accuracy and completeness.
