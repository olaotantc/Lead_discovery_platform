# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement ICP Preview Input
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the input mechanism for URL and short brief to generate an ICP preview.
# Details:
Create a frontend component that accepts a URL and a short brief as input. Implement logic to parse these inputs and generate an industry-agnostic ICP preview, including fields like business category, company size, region, buyer roles, and keywords. Ensure that the input is validated and sanitized before processing.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various URLs and briefs to ensure accurate ICP previews are generated. Validate that all fields are correctly populated and that invalid inputs are handled gracefully.
