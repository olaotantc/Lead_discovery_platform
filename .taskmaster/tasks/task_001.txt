# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the necessary structure and tools for development.
# Details:
Create a new Git repository for the project. Set up the project structure using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with Fastify/Nest for the backend. Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling and React Query for data fetching. Initialize PostgreSQL and Redis databases. Set up BullMQ for job management. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed and configured.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the repository is initialized correctly with all dependencies installed. Ensure that the project can be built and run locally without errors.
