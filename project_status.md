# Lead Discovery Platform - Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02 13:35 UTC
**Current Phase:** Discovery System Multi-Pass Refinement Implemented
**Overall Progress:** 80% (Multi-pass discovery working, testing needed)

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Product:** SignalRunner - Discovery-First Lead Platform MVP v0.2
**Goal:** Paste a URL → receive verified, prioritized leads with evidence-based drafts in ≤10 minutes
**Timeline:** 8 weeks development cycle

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed (Latest Session - 2025-10-02)
- **Multi-Pass Discovery System**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED Phase 1 from refinement analysis
  - Extracts 5-7 specific industry verticals from ICP
  - Searches each vertical separately with 10 companies each
  - Parallel API calls for efficiency (5 verticals × 10 = 50 companies)
  - Includes fallback to single-pass if vertical extraction fails
- **ICP Generation**: Enhanced industry-agnostic system working
- **Candidate Discovery System**: MAJOR OVERHAUL - now finds customers not competitors
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Fixed to score against target segments, not seller's industry
- **Discovery Flow**: New 3-page flow (Start → Summary → Results)
- **JSON Parsing**: Fixed with JSON mode + fallback parsing
- **Match Reasons**: Now describe company characteristics, not their needs
- **Navigation**: Added Discover dropdown with Summary and Results links

### 🔧 Fixed Critical Issues
1. **Competitor vs Customer Bug**: System was finding Asana/ClickUp instead of startups/agencies
   - Root cause: Using `businessCategory` instead of `targetMarket` + `customerSegments`
   - Fix: Rewrote AI prompts and scoring logic

2. **Zero Companies Bug**: JSON parsing errors causing no results
   - Root cause: Malformed JSON from AI responses
   - Fix: Implemented JSON mode with fallback parsing

3. **Wrong Scoring**: Competitors ranked highest
   - Root cause: Scoring against seller's industry instead of target customer profile
   - Fix: Complete rewrite of `companyScoring.ts`

4. **Incorrect Match Reasons**: "Founders need better workflows"
   - Root cause: AI describing what companies need vs what they are
   - Fix: Added explicit examples in prompt

### 🔄 Current Issues (Under Active Development)
- **Quality Problem**: Multi-pass system should reduce famous company bias (TESTING NEEDED)
- **Discovery Time**: May take 90-120 seconds (6 API calls vs 1) - acceptable trade-off
- **Next Phase**: Vertical selector UI to let users choose specific segments

### 📋 Solution Documented
Created `DISCOVERY_REFINEMENT_ANALYSIS.md` with:
- 7 proposed solutions evaluated
- **Recommended Phase 1**: Multi-Pass Industry Refinement (2-3 hours to implement)
- **Recommended Phase 2**: Vertical Selector + Geographic Filter (4-6 hours to implement)

## 🏗️ Architecture Status

### Frontend (`/frontend/`)
- ✅ **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.4 with TypeScript
- ✅ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS configured and verified
- ✅ **State Management**: React Query provider configured
- ✅ **New Pages**:
  - `/start` - ICP generation (cleaned up, localStorage cleared)
  - `/discover/summary` - Shows company count, user selects type (NEW)
  - `/discover/results` - Displays scored companies (NEW)
  - `/contacts` - Contact discovery UI
  - `/drafts` - Draft generation UI (placeholder)
  - `/accounts` - Account management UI (placeholder)
- ✅ **Navigation**: Dropdown menus for Discover workflow

### Backend (`/backend/`)
- ✅ **Framework**: Fastify with TypeScript
- ✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis + BullMQ configured
- ✅ **ICP Inference** (`icpInference.ts`):
  - Industry-agnostic generation
  - Extracts targetMarket, customerSegments, businessCategory
  - **Known Issue**: targetMarket sometimes contains job titles instead of company types

- ✅ **Candidate Sourcing** (`candidateSourcing.ts`):
  - Multi-adapter system (Clearbit, Bing, AI-generated)
  - JSON mode for reliable parsing
  - Explicit prompt engineering to find customers not competitors
  - Blacklists known competitors (Asana, ClickUp, Monday.com)
  - **Current**: Returns 35-50 companies
  - **Next**: Implement multi-pass refinement for better quality

- ✅ **Company Scoring** (`companyScoring.ts`):
  - Scores against `customerSegments` and `targetMarket` (NOT `businessCategory`)
  - 4 facets: industryFit (40%), sizeFit (25%), modelFit (20%), keywordMatch (15%)
  - Returns scored and ranked candidates
  - **Working Correctly**: Startups/agencies rank high, competitors rank low

- ✅ **Contact Discovery** (`contactDiscovery.ts`):
  - Email pattern detection
  - Provider lookup (mock adapters)
  - Verification service
  - BullMQ job processing

## 🚀 Results Comparison

### Before Today's Fixes
- **Results**: 0-35 companies (often 0 due to JSON errors)
- **Companies**: Asana, ClickUp, Monday.com (competitors, not customers)
- **Match Reasons**: "Founders need better workflows" (incorrect - describes needs)
- **Scores**: Competitors ranked highest (100 points for industry match)

### After Today's Fixes
- **Results**: 35-50 companies (consistent, no errors)
- **Companies**: Y Combinator, Techstars, dev agencies, tech startups (actual customers)
- **Match Reasons**: "Tech startup with 50-200 employees" (correct - describes characteristics)
- **Scores**: Target customers ranked highest (startups/agencies get 100 points)

### Remaining Issues
- **Still seeing**: Zapier, Figma, Xero, Basecamp (famous brands)
- **Not seeing enough**: Long tail SMBs, local agencies, niche startups
- **Root cause**: AI defaults to well-known companies it "knows"

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Test Multi-Pass Discovery** ✅ READY TO TEST
   - Use beta.projectmaven.io as test case
   - Verify 50 companies returned (vs previous 35)
   - Check for vertical diversity (5 different types)
   - Confirm fewer famous brands, more SMBs/agencies
   - Monitor discovery time (~90-120 seconds expected)

2. **Add Vertical Selector UI** (Phase 2 from analysis doc)
   - Show user extracted verticals as checkboxes
   - Add optional geographic filter
   - Let user choose 1-3 verticals to focus on
   - **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
   - **Expected Impact**: Highly targeted results

### After Discovery Refinement
3. **Implement Contact Discovery Flow**
   - Add checkboxes to company cards
   - "Get Contacts for X Selected Companies" button
   - Navigate to `/discover/contacts` with selected companies
   - Wire up contact discovery API

4. **Complete Draft Generation**
   - Wire up draft generation API
   - Implement evidence linking
   - Add tone selector

## 📞 Handoff Information for Tomorrow

### What's Working
- ✅ ICP generation from any URL
- ✅ Candidate discovery (finds customers not competitors)
- ✅ Company scoring (correct ranking)
- ✅ 3-page discovery flow
- ✅ Both servers running (frontend:3000, backend:8000)

### What Needs Work
- ⚠️ Discovery quality (too many famous brands, not enough SMBs)
- ⚠️ Discovery quantity (35-50 vs hundreds possible)
- ⚠️ No contact discovery flow (results page is dead-end)
- ⚠️ No draft generation flow

### Key Files to Know
- **Problem Analysis**: `DISCOVERY_REFINEMENT_ANALYSIS.md` (complete 7-solution breakdown)
- **Candidate Sourcing**: `backend/src/services/candidateSourcing.ts` (NEW multi-pass implementation)
  - Lines 191-245: `extractVerticals()` - extracts 5-7 industry verticals
  - Lines 247-317: `sourceAIGeneratedForVertical()` - searches specific vertical
  - Lines 319-357: `sourceAIGenerated()` - orchestrates parallel searches
  - Lines 359-457: `sourceAIGeneratedSinglePass()` - fallback if extraction fails
- **Company Scoring**: `backend/src/services/companyScoring.ts` (lines 55-128 = scoring logic)
- **Discovery UI**: `frontend/src/app/discover/results/page.tsx` (results display)

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend && npm run dev

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Both servers must be running for discovery to work
```

### Test Flow (Multi-Pass Discovery)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Get Started" or "Try Demo"
3. Enter: `beta.projectmaven.io` (or any URL)
4. Optional: Enter brief description
5. Click "Generate ICP Preview"
6. Review ICP, click "Discover Leads"
7. Wait for discovery (~90-120 seconds - NOW LONGER due to 6 API calls)
8. See results page with 50 scored companies across 5 verticals
9. Check backend logs for vertical extraction output
